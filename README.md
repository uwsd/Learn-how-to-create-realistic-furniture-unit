## Summary

I think as absolute beginner with zero knowledge about blender you will have some problems with this course. Section 3 in particular was too bloated. A lot of talking but little showing. But on the other side with minimal knowledge about blender it is a good starting course to deepen knowledge. With the **Post Processing** chapter the tutor shows us, what we can expect if we continue on our path.

## Themed

- Modeling (among others using **Knife tool**)
- Texturing (some simple nodes for gradient texturing, simple wood texturing for the unit)
- Rendering (**cycles**)
- Postprocessing (**rgb_curves**, **color balance**)
